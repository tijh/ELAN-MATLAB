{"name":"ELAN-MATLAB","tagline":"Tools to analyse ELAN-files in MATLAB","body":"### About the project\r\nThis toolbox contains functions to import, analyse and visualise ELAN annotation data. The toolbox is based on the SALEM Toolbox (Hanheide M, Lohse M, Dierker A. 2010 SALEM– Statistical AnaLysis of Elan files in Matlab. In Multimodal Corpora Adv Capturing Coding Anal Multimodality, pp. 121 – 123.). These tools were originally developed for a project on therapist-client interaction in music therapy, a collaboration between Dr Neta Spiro ([Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy, London](http://www.nordoff-robbins.org.uk/)) and Dr Tommi Himberg (@tijh) ([Aalto University](http://nbe.aalto.fi/en/)). \r\n\r\n### Example data\r\nThe toolbox also contains data from the journal article Spiro & Himberg (2016).[Analysing change in music therapy interactions of children with communication difficulties](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rstb.2015.0374) Phil. Trans. R. Soc. B 20150374. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nThe toolbox was inspired by and is based on the SALEM toolbox (Hanheide et al.). The function to read ELAN data into MATLAB is changed only slightly, mainly to reduce its functionality and complexity. The functions to extract metrics and to visualise the data have been written by @tijh. \r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nIf you functions or data from the toolbox, please let us know, and please cite Spiro, N. & Himberg, T.
